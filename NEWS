Since rc-1.5b2 was released, many fixes have been made to the
autoconfiguration code, some of them critical.

A few bugs in the rc code itself have been fixed.  These were mostly
obscure.  I could not have tracked them down so quickly without Source
Navigator---it's a great way to find your way around code (plug!).

rc now uses GNU automake.  Although I feel that automake is sticking
plaster to mend a broken leg, it has made my job as maintainer easier.
(Errm, apart from tracking down bugs in automake itself, and Perl, that
is.)  For people building rc, it's now possible (depending on your
flavour of `make') to build in a separate directory from the source.

Creeping featurism: rc now has a `-V' switch to report its version
number.

Binaries of rc-1.5b3 are typically a few kilobytes smaller than 1.5b2.
I believe this is due to improved autoconfiguration: we are now much
more careful only to include code that will be used.

rc-1.5b3 will build under the beta19 release of CygWin32.  It won't run
trip.rc successfully, and does not appear to be very stable.

The detection of signal names has been completely revised.

The interaction with readline has been redone, principally to work
around bugs in the readline library.

See ChangeLog for more details.
