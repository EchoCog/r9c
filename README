BUGS

Send bug reports to <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk>.  If a core dump is
generated, sending a backtrace will help a great deal.  You can get a
backtrace like this.

	; gdb rc core
	(gdb) where
	<<<BACKTRACE INFO>>>
	(gdb)

Also, always report the machine, OS (`uname -a'), and compiler used to
make rc; this information is extremely valuable.

FEEPING CREATURISM

See the end of the man page, under "INCOMPATABILITIES" for (known?)
differences from the "real" rc.  Most of these changes were necessary
to get rc to work in a reasonable fashion on a real (i.e. commercial,
non-Labs) Unix system; a few were changes motivated by concern about
some inadequacies in the original design.
