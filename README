BUGS

Send bug reports to <tgoodwin@cygnus.co.uk>.  If a core dump is
generated, sending a backtrace will help a great deal.  You can get a
backtrace like this.

	; gdb rc core
	(gdb) where
	<<<BACKTRACE INFO>>>
	(gdb)

Also, always report the machine, OS (`uname -a'), and compiler used to
make rc; this information is extremely valuable.

FEEPING CREATURISM

See the end of the man page, under "INCOMPATABILITIES" for (known?)
differences from the "real" rc.  Most of these changes were necessary
to get rc to work in a reasonable fashion on a real (i.e. commercial,
non-Labs) Unix system; a few were changes motivated by concern about
some inadequacies in the original design.

ASSOCIATED PACKAGES

rc uses a set of printing routines originally written by Paul Haahr.
Scott Schwartz has developed this as a separate package which is
available from comp.sources.unix v29i017.

rc can be linked with the editline library.  This was developed by
Simmule Turner and Rich $alz, and is available from here.

    ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tgoodwin/rc/misc/editline-1.5.tar.gz
 
A package with similar aims (that is, to be a lightweight command line
editing library) is vrl.  This was developed by Gert-Jan Vons, and is
available from here.

    ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tgoodwin/rc/misc/vrl-1.2.tar.gz

Alternatively, rc can be linked with GNU readline versions 2.1 or 2.2.
This is available from the master FSF distribution site, and its many
mirrors.

    ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/readline-2.2.tar.gz

There are a number of other programs which, like rc, are Unix
implementations of Plan 9 tools.

Rob Pike's editor sam has been ported to X, and is available from here.

     http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/research/sam.shar.gz

Gary Capell has written wily, a reimplementation of the Plan 9 acme.
Although it may sound oxymoronic, wily is a minimalist "integrated
development environment" for X.  Further information can be found here.

James Matthew Farrow has written 9term, and David Hogan 9wm.  These are,
respectively, a terminal emulator and window manager for X with the Plan
9 "look and feel".
