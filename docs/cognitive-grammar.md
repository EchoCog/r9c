# Cognitive Grammar

## Overview

This document describes the hypergraph encoding system, Scheme integration, and ECAN (Economic Attention Allocation) attention management for the cognitive grammar layer.

## Hypergraph Encoding

### Conceptual Framework
The cognitive grammar represents knowledge and processes as hypergraphs where:
- Nodes represent concepts, words, or cognitive states
- Hyperedges represent relationships, transformations, or rules
- Weights encode strength of associations and attention allocation

### Data Structures
```scheme
;; Basic hypergraph node
(define-struct node
  (id concept strength links))

;; Hyperedge connecting multiple nodes  
(define-struct hyperedge
  (id nodes relation weight))

;; Complete hypergraph
(define-struct hypergraph
  (nodes edges attention-map))
```

### Shell Command Mapping
Shell commands are mapped to cognitive transformations:
```scheme
;; Command parsing as pattern recognition
(define (parse-command cmd-string)
  (hypergraph-pattern-match cmd-string command-patterns))

;; Command execution as cognitive state transition
(define (execute-command cmd context)
  (apply-cognitive-transformation cmd context attention-state))
```

## Scheme Integration

### Core Functions
```scheme
;; Initialize cognitive grammar system
(define (init-cognitive-grammar)
  (load-base-patterns)
  (initialize-attention-network)
  (setup-command-mappings))

;; Process shell input through cognitive layer
(define (process-shell-input input context)
  (let ((parsed (parse-command input))
        (attended (allocate-attention parsed)))
    (execute-with-context attended context)))

;; Update attention allocation based on results
(define (update-attention-state result feedback)
  (adjust-node-strengths result)
  (propagate-attention-changes feedback))
```

### Pattern Recognition
```scheme
;; Define cognitive patterns for shell operations
(define command-patterns
  '((pipe-pattern (cmd1 "|" cmd2) -> (data-flow cmd1 cmd2))
    (redirect-pattern (cmd ">" file) -> (output-redirect cmd file))
    (variable-pattern ("$" var) -> (variable-access var))
    (function-pattern ("fn" name body) -> (function-definition name body))))

;; Pattern matching with attention weighting
(define (weighted-pattern-match input patterns attention)
  (rank-by-attention 
    (filter-matches input patterns)
    attention))
```

## ECAN Attention Allocation

### Attention Economics
The Economic Attention Allocation (ECAN) system manages cognitive resources:

```scheme
;; Attention value structure
(define-struct attention-value
  (short-term-importance
   long-term-importance  
   urgency
   confidence))

;; Attention allocation algorithm
(define (allocate-attention nodes current-context)
  (let ((importance-map (calculate-importance nodes))
        (urgency-map (calculate-urgency nodes current-context))
        (budget (get-attention-budget)))
    (distribute-attention budget importance-map urgency-map)))

;; Attention spreading activation
(define (spread-attention node-set activation-level)
  (for-each
    (lambda (node)
      (update-node-attention node activation-level)
      (propagate-to-neighbors node (* activation-level 0.8)))
    node-set))
```

### Dynamic Resource Management
```scheme
;; Monitor and adjust attention allocation
(define (attention-management-loop)
  (while #t
    (let ((current-state (get-cognitive-state))
          (performance (get-performance-metrics)))
      (adjust-attention-parameters current-state performance)
      (garbage-collect-low-attention-nodes)
      (sleep attention-update-interval))))

;; Attention-based memory management
(define (cognitive-garbage-collection threshold)
  (remove-nodes-below-threshold threshold)
  (consolidate-similar-patterns)
  (refresh-important-connections))
```

## PLN Integration (Probabilistic Logic Networks)

### Uncertainty Reasoning
```scheme
;; Truth value representation
(define-struct truth-value
  (strength confidence))

;; Probabilistic inference rules
(define (plr-deduction premise1 premise2)
  (make-truth-value
    (* (tv-strength premise1) (tv-strength premise2))
    (min (tv-confidence premise1) (tv-confidence premise2))))

;; Integration with shell reasoning
(define (probabilistic-command-evaluation cmd context)
  (let ((confidence (estimate-success-probability cmd context))
        (importance (calculate-command-importance cmd)))
    (weighted-execution cmd confidence importance)))
```

### Inference Engine
```scheme
;; Forward chaining inference
(define (forward-chain facts rules)
  (let loop ((derived-facts facts))
    (let ((new-facts (apply-rules derived-facts rules)))
      (if (equal? new-facts derived-facts)
          derived-facts
          (loop new-facts)))))

;; Backward chaining for goal achievement
(define (backward-chain goal rules facts)
  (if (member goal facts)
      '(success)
      (find-proof-path goal rules facts)))
```

## Integration with Shell Operations

### Command Enhancement
Every shell command is enhanced with cognitive processing:
1. Parse command through hypergraph pattern recognition
2. Allocate attention based on command importance and context
3. Execute with probabilistic reasoning about outcomes
4. Update cognitive state based on results
5. Adjust attention allocation for future commands

### Emergent Behavior
The system enables emergent cognitive patterns through:
- Cross-command attention propagation
- Pattern reinforcement through successful executions
- Adaptive command prediction and suggestion
- Context-aware resource allocation
